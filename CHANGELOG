# Change Log

## 0.2.2

Released on February 13, 2024.

### Fixed

* Correct reference in README

### Added

* New faster preprocessing method for GUI. Previosly resampling was done prior to cropping. Now first a large cropping is done, followed by resampling and finally a tighter crop is done. This drastically speed up pre- and post-processing, especially for larger volumetric images with small objects of interest.

## 0.2.1

Released on October 26, 2023.

### Fixed

* Improve Docker image
* Fixed bug when no test segmentations were present in generating dataset json
* Fixed bug where self-trained model was loaded while using deployed model

### Added

* Support for MONAI 1.2

## 0.2.0

Released on June 20, 2023.

### Added

* Zenodo release
* Release on Pypi
* LICENSE added to all files
* Documentation for releases
* WORC models available on https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8054038
* Models now downloadable and installable
* Added docker image for GUI (or atleast monailabel server for GUI)

### Changed

* Personal author to group (BIGR)

## 0.1.0

Released on June 14, 2023.

### Added

* First version of the Minimally Interactive Segmentation Method, containing:
    - InteractiveNet: a self-configuring workflow for finding the best configuration for preprocessing, training, postprocessing, ensembling based on dataset characteristics for interactive segmentation.
    - Generating synthetic interactions from ground truth segmentation, in order to pilot interactive segmentation.
    - A graphical user interface (GUI) in order to use InteractiveNet in 3D slicer or OHIF
    - Deployment of trained models
    - Licence, documentation and setup files.
